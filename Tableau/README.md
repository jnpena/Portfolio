### World Flood Data (1985–2021)  

This Tableau project analyzes global flood data collected by the **Dartmouth Flood Observatory**, covering the years 1985–2021.

- **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**:  
  - Analyzed raw data and created the new variable **Total_Affected** by combining *Dead* and *Displaced* to better measure the overall severity and impact of floods.  
  - Standardized the variable **Main Cause** into a cleaner, consistent category called **Cause_Category**, resolving issues with inconsistent spelling and capitalization.  

- **Visualizations**:  
  - **World Map & Bar Charts**: Displayed flood distribution and impact by country. A key insight emerged: the country with the highest number of floods was not the same as the country with the highest number of people affected. This suggests differences in infrastructure and disaster response capacity.  
  - **Bubble Chart**: Highlighted the frequency of flood causes using the cleaned **Cause_Category** variable.  
  - **Line Graph with Trend Line**: Showed the rising frequency of floods over time, revealing a year-over-year increase.  

- **Interactive Dashboard**:  
  - Combined all visuals into a single dashboard with a **year-range filter**, allowing users to explore changes in flood frequency and severity over time.  
  - Designed for intuitive use, enabling quick comparisons between regions, causes, and impacts.  

This project demonstrates my ability to clean messy data, engineer meaningful features, and build clear, interactive dashboards that reveal real-world insights.
