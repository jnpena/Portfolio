# Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains projects that demonstrate my proficiency in key languages, tools, and methodologies used in data analytics and data science.  

The goal of these projects is not only to showcase my technical skills, but also to provide meaningful insights into real-world problems and scenarios.  

### Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** – Data visualization and dashboards  
- **Jupyter Notebook (Python)** – Data analysis, modeling, and machine learning  
- **SQL** – Data querying, cleaning, and transformation  
- **Excel** – Data wrangling, analysis, and visualization

Each project in this repository includes:  
- A **project description** outlining the business problem and objectives  
- **Data sources** and preprocessing steps  
- **Analysis & results**, with visualizations or dashboards where relevant  
- A **README** file summarizing the project highlights
